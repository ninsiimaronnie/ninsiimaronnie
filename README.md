HTML wrangler by day, CSS cowboy by night. Just a newbie trying to learn the ropes of front-end dev while avoiding analysis paralysis. 

Currently herding divs and taming tables with HTML. Wrangling fonts and colors with my trusty CSS lasso. Next up: the wild west of JavaScript!

Pushing pixels instead of paper these days. Leave the 9-5 office job behind for a life of code. There's no 'I' in team, but there is in CSS - so that's what I'm focusing on for now.

Rookie developer looking for my next side quest. Drop some open source issues my way and I'll rope 'em in! Just don't ask me to touch any backend just yet - I'm still a frontend fledgling. 

Level 1 code monkey seeking XP. Help me level up by starring my repos!
